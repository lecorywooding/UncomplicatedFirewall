# What this is about...
##### This is a lab intended to teach an individual how to configure UFW to mitigate potential attacks or unwanted traffic. 
##### For this lab I recommend using Ubuntu and Kali Linux, in a virtual machine environment, connected via their own 
##### NAT network. 
### All software used is open-source
